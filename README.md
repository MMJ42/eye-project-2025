Due to data privacy restrictions and file size limits on GitHub (max 25MB), the full dataset and some model weights are not publicly available in this repository.
If you are interested in accessing the eye-tracking data or the model weights, please contact the authors directly.

The pretrained weights used in this project can be downloaded from the Swin Transformer GitHub repository (https://github.com/SwinTransformer).
